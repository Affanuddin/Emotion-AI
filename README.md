# Emotion-AI
The aim of this project is to classify people’s emotions based on their
face images.
• In this case study, we will assume that you work as an AI/ML consultant.
• You have been hired by a Startup in San Diego to build, train and deploy
a system that automatically monitors people emotions and expressions.
• The team has collected more than 20000 facial images, with their
associated facial expression labels and around 2000 images with their
facial key-point annotations.
